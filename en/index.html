                    <section class="about">
                        <p>I am a student at Trybe, studying full-stack web development, and currently residing in the Bras√≠lia-DF area. My goal is to make a career transition from the hospitality industry to the field of development.<br><br>
                        With over four years of experience in the hospitality industry, I have accumulated various unique experiences over time. Now, I am seeking new challenges that will allow for significant personal and professional growth. My focus is on contributing to the development and/or maintenance of web platforms, always aiming for the quality and efficiency of the final product. I believe that my background in previous experiences will be an asset in this new path.<br><br>
                        I am very excited about the opportunity to expand my knowledge in the field of web development and apply it in a creative and innovative way. I have a strong passion for learning and am willing to face the challenges that this journey may bring. My dedication and eagerness to grow professionally are my strengths, and I am eager to contribute to development teams on challenging and exciting projects.<br><br>
                        I believe that the combination of my skills acquired in hospitality, along with the new skills I have been developing at Trybe, will make me a well-rounded and committed professional striving for excellence. I am confident that this career change will lead me to a promising future in the field of web development.<br><br>
                        Thank you for your attention and the opportunity to share a bit about my goals and motivations. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of making a positive contribution to the team and future projects.</p>
